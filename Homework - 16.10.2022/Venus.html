                                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. Venus, like Mercury, appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star with a synodic period of 1.6 years. It is, after the Moon, the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad sunlight.

                                Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System, with a surface gravity minimally lower than on Earth, but having only an induced magnetosphere. The carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus is the densest of the four terrestrial planets. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from Earth in light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[20][21] but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[22] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of an internally induced magnetic field.[23] At roughly 50 km above the surface atmospheric conditions reach Earth-like temperatures and levels of pressure.

                                Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth spacecrafts were sent towards (Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be reached, impacted and successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in the visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, such as crewed atmospheric missions at levels with almost Earth-like conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation; in recent years, the topic has received active research with possible signs of life having been found.

                                Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's "sister" or "twin".[28] The diameter of Venus is 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[29] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid. Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen—both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface—and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[30] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 km (5⁄8 mi) under Earth's oceans.
